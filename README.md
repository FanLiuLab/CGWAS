# C-GWAS
A whole solution for illustrating multi-trait effect of all SNPs with a set of GWASs summary data.

## Overview
C-GWAS begins with GWASs summary as inputs and outputs a single vector of combined p-values testing if the null is deviated. For each SNP, the null is the absence of any effect on all traits, and the alternative is that its
effect deviates from 0 for at least one trait.

C-GWAS integrates two different statistical methods to ensure the optimal power under various and complex scenarios while keeping a stable study-wide type-I error rate. The first method uses an iterative effect based inversed
covariance weighting (i-EbICoW), which appears the most powerful when the assumption (all SNPs share the same varianceâ€“covariance matrix of effect sizes across traits) tends to be satisfied or moderately violated. The second
method is a truncated Wald test (TWT) which is more powerful than i-EbICoW when the assumption tends to be severely violated. For each SNP, TWT proposes the best subset of phenotypes by applying the Wald test to all subsets
determined under a series of preset thresholds.

C-GWAS controls the study-wide type-I error rate in an empirical manner via simulations and adjust the resultant p-values in such a way that they are directly comparable with those from traditional GWAS of a single trait.
